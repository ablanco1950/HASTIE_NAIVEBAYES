
HASTIE_NAIVEBAYES: from the Hastie_10_2.csv file obtained by the procedure described in
 https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_hastie_10_2.html, used both as test and training,
 obtains a success rate in the training of 89,29% and 87,13% in the test. These rates are slightly below that obtained by other procedures (see reference at the end), but they can be accepted, taking into account that a large number of the records do not meet the condition:
y [i] = 1 if np.sum (X [i] ** 2)> 9.34 else -1
that is, there are erroneous data in the training.

The main difference in this model comparing with others is that each field is weihgted separately. In other models weights are identical for all fields.

Resources: Java 8

Functioning:

Hastie_NaiveBayes.jar and Hastie_NaiveBayes.bat are downloaded to any directory. The test file Hastie10_2.csv is downloaded to the C: directory.

It runs: Hastie_NaiveBayes.bat

The training and test file margins go as parameters, initially they are from register 0 to 9600 for training and from 9601 to 12000 for test, but they can be changed.

You can also use a test file that has the same structure as Hastie10_2.csv, in which the class goes in the first position of the record, by changing the only line in Hastie_NaiveBayes.bat.

On screen it offers the results and produces a file c: HastieTestWithClassAsigned.txt with the classes assigned to the test file.
